# DBT_Airbnb


🏠 DBT Airbnb Project

This repository contains a dbt (Data Build Tool) project designed to transform raw Airbnb data into analytics-ready datasets using Snowflake as the data warehouse. The project demonstrates industry-standard analytics engineering practices with a strong focus on scalability, maintainability, and data quality.

📌 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust end-to-end data transformation pipeline that converts raw Airbnb source data into well-structured fact and dimension tables suitable for reporting and analytics.

The project emphasizes:
	•	Clear separation of concerns using layered dbt models
	•	Efficient processing of large datasets
	•	Historical tracking of dimensional changes
	•	Reproducible and version-controlled data transformations


🧩 Key Concepts Covered

This project showcases the following dbt and data-engineering concepts:
	•	Source modeling using dbt source() definitions
	•	Staging, intermediate, and marts layers
	•	Seed-based reference data loading
	•	Change Data Capture (CDC) using SCD Type 2
	•	Incremental model strategy for performance optimization
	•	Fact and dimension table design for analytics


🔄 High-Level Data Flow
	•	Raw Airbnb tables are ingested into Snowflake
	•	Source models define and document raw datasets
	•	Staging models standardize and clean raw data
	•	Intermediate models apply business logic and enrich data
	•	Final marts expose analytics-ready fact and dimension tables

This layered approach ensures clarity, reusability, and reliable downstream analytics.


🎯 Outcomes

By implementing this project:
	•	Raw Airbnb data is transformed into trusted analytical datasets
	•	Historical changes in key attributes are preserved
	•	Compute costs are minimized through incremental processing
	•	Data consumers can query consistent and well-documented tables

The result is a production-grade dbt project that mirrors real-world analytics engineering workflows.
